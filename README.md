My entry for Ludum Dare 45 - Starting with nothing

Made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 45 (Theme: Starting with nothing). Made with the open source game engine Godot Engine. Programming done with their proprietary
scripting language GDScript. (Python like in its syntax)

A platformer where you need to collect modules for all your actions in order to escape.
